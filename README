The following script "MaxQuont_QC_script" is used to asses the quality control metrices from the maxquont runs.
To use it you need to do the following:
1. install the PTXQC plus all the dependencies
2. Provide the path to the "txt" directory with the variable name of interest
NOTE: you can also use choose.dir() function to select the "txt" directory
And run the job! Good luck
